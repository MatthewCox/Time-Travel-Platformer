Premake is a handy little tool that automagically builds project and solution files for various IDEs from a single script which defines your project.

Anyway, to generate the project files, run:

	BuildProjects.bat	(Windows)
	BuildProjects.sh	(Linux, maybe Mac?)

If you only want to build the specific project files you need, open one of those in a text editor, or look up premake4 online! Geez :P
